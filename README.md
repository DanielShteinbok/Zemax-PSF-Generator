# PSF Generator
Code using the ZOS-API to generate a bunch of point-spread functions from a bunch of fields (different points on the object).
For use with [my version of the Waller-Lab's MultiWienerNet](https://github.com/DanielShteinbok/MultiWienerNet).

The original MultiWienerNet can be found [here](https://github.com/Waller-Lab/MultiWienerNet), but the difference is that
my fork is meant to work with CSVs rather than MATLAB .mat files. This PSF generator will produce CSV files.
